# DotKakasi

DotKakasi is a .NET Natural Language Processing (NLP) library to transliterate hiragana, katakana and kanji (Japanese text) into r≈çmaji (Latin/Roman alphabet).

It is based on the [pykakasi](https://github.com/miurahr/pykakasi) library, which is written in Python.

Also some files in this repository are from a former incomplete project: [DotKakasi by codeyu](https://github.com/codeyu/DotKakasi)
